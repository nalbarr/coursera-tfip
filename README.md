- Course 2:  [Convolutional Neural Network in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow)
- Course 3:  [Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow)
- Course 4:  [Sequences, Time Series and Prediction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction)

### Eureka! moment
#### If you plan to only audit class, one thing to focus on
* TBD

### Key Takeaways
* Unlike previous Andrew Ng courses that were driven with plain Jupyter notebooks, it was refreshing to quickly browse, learn and apply concepts using Google Colab notebooks.  I felt way more productive (and it is very easy to save you work for reference later).
